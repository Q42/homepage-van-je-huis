## ðŸš€ Getting started

1. Install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Run `nvm i` to install/use the correct node version as described in .nvmrc
3. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
4. Configure and use prettier and editor config in your IDE of choice to conform to the project formatting rules
5. Run `npm run dev` to start development server and navigate to `localhost:[PORT]/nl/` in your browser as we don't have a homepage and `localhost:[PORT]/` will give a `404`
6. Run `npm run storybook` to start Storybook, here you can find all the components. See [Storybook](#storybook)

To run a production build:

- Run `npm run build`
- Run `npm run preview`

### Adding components

We use plop to add new components. This way all new components have an accompanying story and are uniform.

`npm run plop [name of your component]`

### Storybook & Plop

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to build all the components and pages. This way we can built isolated and create a nice overview of all the components we have.
Run `npm run storybook` to open Storybook. Documentation of the components can be found here as well.

Creating a new component:

1. Run Storybook: `npm run storybook`
2. Now you can see your component in Storybook
3. Start building!
